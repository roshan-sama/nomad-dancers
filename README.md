## Inspiration

Meme title: "How all-star dancers go to so many events"
Meme picture: A view from the back of an SUV, whose rear seats are replaced with a bed and a dressed, suggesting that the occupants sleep in their car.

These were real comments people made under that meme, and what inspired the creation of this site

- Honestly, if I could be a nomad going from event to event every weekend, I'd be down
- As long as I can borrow a shower at an event, this wouldnt be half bad 😆🚿
- That’s a 3rd Gen. Honda Odyssey (2005-2010), in case anyone’s curious. Very reliable, can be had fairly cheaply private party.
The Mk VI Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagens are also a great option for car camping. The 2.5L engine is very reliable.
- Ya ive done this rather than pay for a hotel room for the weekend. Lol
- I’ve been thinking more and more about car camping for events. Provided weather is not too hot/cold. 🤷🏻‍♀️
- This gave me another idea for housing at Liberty Swing (Picture of a 1994 GMC Vandura G2500 being sold for $6000)

Based on these comments, we can extract an initial set of principles this project should follow

Primary goal:
Allow travelling dancers to connect with resources to aid with a nomadic lifestyle

How I think this app can help
1) Travelling dancers

Other principles I think are necessary
1) Privacy - users don't specify names, instead get a two word identified when adding a pin to the map
2) Chain of trust

## Why travel by car instead of flight

Flights, hotels and rental cars can be expensive. As dancers, we have an extensive network of friends and mutual friends across the world.

We can leverage this network of trusted connections that you don't often find in other communities. Because there are so many dance styles, and some people attend mroe than one, its highly likely that you'll have some dancers (e.g. lindy hop) at their home scene, while others are travelling to their scene (WCS)

Just make sure to bridge the divide with memes beforehand so that there's no animosity between groups.
